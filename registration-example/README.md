# Registration Form

## CHALLENGE TIME

Try to build a registration form for your own exam project, including all the information fields that you need and updating the user class to match your UML Class Diagramm. Afterwards try to implement the following additional features:

1. Implement an 'If Statement' to make sure all input fields are filled out before submitting the form

2. Implement appropriate checks to make sure the provided information is correct e.g. the password is at least 8 digits long

3. If the input is not accepted, clear all fields in the form and display a message what the user has done wrong e.g. "Please choose a stronger password"

4. Implement a redirect ot the newly created login page after the user has successfully registered on you site

#### BONUS CHALLENGE (PREMIUM)

Try to implement a functioning login on the login.html page with all the required .js files. Until now only make sure it works with the hardcoded user "Henrik Thorn", as we don't know how to save the newly registered user in localStorage yet.
